    <h1>Word Ordering Code</h1>

    <p1>As much as I would've love for the code to be accessible here, directly through GitHub I unfortunately could not get camera permissions to cooperate. A link to the code can be found below.</p1>

        <p3>Originally, I was planning on using face mesh as a trigger, something like opening and closing your mouth would’ve been interesting, however with some more research on ml5js, as well as looking up YouTube videos and discussions about the different features I decided to go along a different route.
        </p3>
        <p4>Instead I chose to go with using handPose in ml5js, my goal is going to be to create an interactive program where you can use your hands on the camera in order move stuff around on the screen.
        </p4>
    
        <div>
            <p>
                
            </p>
    
        </div>

    <div>
        <p5>To start I imported the handPose code into p5js
        </p5>

    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            
        </p>

    </div>

    <img src = "handpose1.png"><img>

    <div>
        <p>
            
        </p>

    </div>

    <p6>Once I played around with handPose for a bit I started working on my code. To start I created my camera, I did my best to make for a good interactive experience by “flipping” it.</p6>

    <div>
        <p>
            
        </p>

    </div>

    <img src = "Cameracode.png"><img>

    <div>
        <p>
            
        </p>

    </div>

    <p>For much of this process I was following some video tutorials on how to set up this kind of interaction correctly. Turns out, you can alter which specific “key points” to highlight and in my case, do things. In my case I want to track my index finger and my thumb so I can later try and grab things with those two points. I started by setting up handPose to track a few of the specific key points with the HandPose 
        </p>
    
    <div>
        <p>

        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="keypoints.png"><img>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>

        </p>
    </div>

    <p>My next step was setting up the text so that it could be placed on the screen and then manipulated through handPose and the keypoints. I started out by making them appear randomly on the screen.</p>
    <div>
        <p>

        </p>
    </div>
    <img src="textsetup.png"><img>
    <div>
        <p>

        </p>
    </div>
    <p>I also learned how to implement fonts into p5 (thank you YouTube!) so I chose a font for the text and applied it, I used a font called Outfit for the words</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>At this point my output was looking something like the image below, but I had a few problems... for one, the words all started in the top left which I didn't love, and second, the actual grabbing on the words wasn't working yet either, so I needed to set that up.</p>
