    <h1>Word Ordering Code</h1>

    <p1>As much as I would've love for the code to be accessible here, directly through GitHub I unfortunately could not get camera permissions to cooperate. A link to the code can be found below.</p1>

        <p3>Originally, I was planning on using face mesh as a trigger, something like opening and closing your mouth wouldâ€™ve been interesting, however with some more research on ml5js, as well as looking up YouTube videos and discussions about the different features I decided to go along a different route.
        </p3>
        <p4>Instead I chose to go with using handPose in ml5js, my goal is going to be to create an interactive program where you can use your hands on the camera in order move stuff around on the screen.

    <div>
        <p5>To start I imported the handPose code into p5js
