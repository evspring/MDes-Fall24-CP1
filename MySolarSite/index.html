    <h1>Interactive UI Project</h1>
    <p>I made the code for this project through following a tutorial online where you could utilize the equation for gravity to make a small physics simulation. The goal was to have a planet and a sun that would impact each other based on their respective sizes which could be determined by the user through interactive sliders. </p>
