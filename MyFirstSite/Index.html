        <p>And the final major part you'll need are your keycaps. These can make your keyboard look, sound and feel different and are highly customizable.</p>

         <p> With all these parts you'll be able to build any kind of keyboard you'd like with full customizability to the shape, feel, color, and sound of the keyboard. There are a ton of options to choose from.</p>
